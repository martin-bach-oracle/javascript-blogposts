# JavaScript Blog Posts

This directory contains all the code used in my JavaScript blog posts at <https://martincarstenbach.com>. These are mainly static, eg you'll find a list of (node, typescript, Oracle, ...) versions a given project was tested against. As time progresses the contents might not be applicable to the then current versions, in which case I'd appreciate if you could let me know by creating an issue
